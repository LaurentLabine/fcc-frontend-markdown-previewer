I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It is built using the React Library coupled Redux for state management and Styled-Components for the styling.

It answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer with the tests that can be run from the page itself.

## Possible Improvements

Future possible improvements could include implementing using React Hooks and add a full-screen visualization functionality.
